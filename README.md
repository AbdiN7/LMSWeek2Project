# LMSWeek2Project
This is a collaborated project.
A Command linue user interface, to manage user inputs to add/remove library branches, check out library books, update user information, etc.
This project has taught me alot about managing, a contributing to a repository with a group. 
Being able to make my code easy to read, and modular enough so that it can be connected/used by others to perform a given task.
